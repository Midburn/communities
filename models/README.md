## Models Folder
### Keep models (constants, libs etc...) relevant to both client side (`/src` folder) and server.

#### Group translator

For a smooth transition between Sparks model and local DB structure there's translation models (in `group-translator.js`) - you may use these to create parsed/combined values also.
